Doodle: Pow! Those spiders are no match for us!
Dan: Yeah! They’re just slightly larger spiders of the real world! 
Dan: Seeing so many of them up close, they really don’t seem too scary after all.

The Queen appears.

Queen: Seems to me you’re still cheerful and upbeat, little boy. Not to worry, everyone fears many things.

Queen: Silly boy, a little one like you stands no chance, as you will learn in due time. 
Queen: If you decide to join me now, however, we can stop the scary theatrics right now. Isn’t that just swell?

The Queen waves her hand once more, as the world and its surroundings start to change.
Queen: See ya later, little one!
<<Move Queen offright queenheight 0.5>>
The Queen fades away, with a slightly smaller smirk this time.
<<Hide Queen>>

Dan: "Hey, wait!!"
