Dan loves drawing, especially doodling and building his own fantasy castle fortress with tower blocks. 
His first and favourite character that he drew as Doodle. 
Such a drawn character was a personified representation of Dan himself and his adventurous nature. 
In his dreams, Dan would join in with Doodle in his imaginary world as they went on countless adventures to places wild and unknown.
