      to destroy!
    rectPosition: {x: 215, y: 239, z: 0}
  - text: This shows the health of the base. It is the source of our power to create.
      Do not let it get destroyed!
    rectPosition: {x: 226, y: 156, z: 0}

      to a tile to build on it, it will turn green.
    rectPosition: {x: -205, y: -222, z: 0}
  - text: Careful! Building takes 2 seconds. We can't move away while building, or
      I would have to scrap our progress!
    rectPosition: {x: -205, y: -222, z: 0}
  - text: Towers have limited range, so plan well - a good plan is half the battle
      won! Hover over the shop icons to learn more about their abilities.
    rectPosition: {x: -205, y: -222, z: 0}

      menu...
    rectPosition: {x: -205, y: -222, z: 0}

      hit enemies, they inflict certain powerful effects! '
    rectPosition: {x: -205, y: -222, z: 0}
  - text: Hover over them to learn more about what they do. They can be pretty expensive,
      so use them wisely.
    rectPosition: {x: -205, y: -222, z: 0}
  - text: Psst! When 2 different types of elements land on an enemy, they can produce
      a reaction with an even stronger effect! Tower placement is crucial!
    rectPosition: {x: -205, y: -222, z: 0}
  - text: Simply right click away anywhere to hide the menu. You can always learn
      more about the elements from this guide book here!
